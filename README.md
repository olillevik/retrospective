retrospective
=============

This is a workshop for teaching retrospective teqniuqes that at the same time give and understanding of how difficult it is to convey an idea using just written language.

Quote from jhannes blog http://johannesbrodwall.com/2007/03/05/a-retrospective-training-workshop/:
"The workshop works like this: The participants are divided into teams of six or so. It works best with about four or five teams. Each team is further subdivided into “developers” and “customers”, which sit apart during the workshop. When the exercise begins, the “customers” will be given a picture on a piece of paper. They are to describe the picture to the developers using only written instructions. Only one “customer” can visit the “developers” at any time. The teams are given five to ten minutes to plan their work before the exercise begins. Then they are given ten minutes to complete the first picture. After they have completed the picture, the “customers” and “developers” join together to do a quick retrospective for the next round. The exercise is then repeated."
